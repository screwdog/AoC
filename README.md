A repository for my various Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) solutions. All solutions to 2022 include a "Hints.md" giving detailed suggestions on how to solve the puzzle and the Julia language and standard library features that may be of assistance. The source code to all 2022 puzzles is commented and I have aimed to make them as easy to understand and as helpful as possible. My hints, comments, and solutions are geared towards a range of beginners but primarily either people struggling with the puzzle itself, or experienced programmers attempting to learn Julia.
