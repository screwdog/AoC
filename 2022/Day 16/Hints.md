General Hints
=============

The naive approach here would be to construct sequences of actions that we take: [move to XX, open valve, move to YY, etc]. However, this would require enumerating sequences of length 30 (one action per minute), and at each step there are an average of about 3 possible actions. That is, we'd need to check 3^30 â‰ˆ 2e14 sequences, which is not feasible.

A lot of these sequences would represent aimless, cyclical wandering. We'd like to move more efficiently but we can't just eliminate retreading our steps as we may have to travel through some tunnels multiple times in order to access certain valves.

Instead, we can concentrate on sequences of valves to be opened in order: [open XX, open YY, etc]. We can then take the shortest path between these valves. This means that the sequence length is no longer constant (the number of valves we can open in time changes depending on which ones we open), but they no longer include redundant movement.

This means that instead of considering which valves are connected, we instead need to calculate the shortest path distances between each pair of valves. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is ideal for this situation.

The other optimisation we can make is to eliminate all broken valves from consideration. Once we've calculated the shortest paths between valves we can then consider the subgraph consisting only of valves that actually affect the pressure. This roughly halves the problem size.

Unfortunately, the problem now is to find an optimal path through the graph of valves which is a variation of the Travelling Salesman Problem, for which no efficient solution exists. So we need simply check each sequence of valves and find the maximum pressure released.

Part 2 requires us to adjust our search algorithm to only consider a subset of valves - so we can find the optimal sequence for either us or the elephant.
