General Hints
=============

Congratulations on making it this far! The difficulty here is conversion to and from the SNAFU number system. Surprisingly, the usual methods for converting to a different base work for signed-digit representations.

Julia Functions
===============

* `mod(n, range)` returns the equivalent value to `n` in the given `range`.
* `foldl`/`foldr` reduce an iterable with guaranteed associativity.
